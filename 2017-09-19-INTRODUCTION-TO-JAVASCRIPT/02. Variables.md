# Variables

```javascript
// This line of code sets the variable location to the string New York City
const location = 'New York City';

// This line of code sets the variable latitude to the number 40.7
let latitude = 40.7;

// This line of code sets the variable inNorthernHemisphere to true
let inNorthernHemisphere = true;


// Add the following lines of code to the bottom of app.js:

console.log(location);
console.log(latitude);
console.log(inNorthernHemisphere);

// Create a constant variable named entree and set it to equal to the string 'Enchiladas'.
const entree = 'Enchiladas';

// Now, under the entree variable, create a constant variable named price that saves the number 12.
const price = 12;

// Under the price variable, use console.log() to print the value saved to entree.
console.log(entree);

// On the following line, use console.log() to print the value saved to price.
console.log(price);

// Create a let variable called changeMe and set it equal to the Boolean true.
let changeMe = true;

// Set the changeMe variable to the boolean false. Log the value saved to changeMe to the console.
changeMe = false;

console.log(`My name is ${myName}. My favorite city is ${myCity}.`);

```


## Let's review what we learned:

  - Variables hold reusable data in a program.
  - JavaScript will throw an error if you try to reassign const variables.
  - You can reassign variables that you create with the let keyword.
  - Unset variables store the primitive data type undefined.
  - Mathematical assignment operators make it easy to calculate a new value and assign it to the same variable.
  - The + operator is used to interpolate (combine) multiple strings.
  - In JavaScript ES6, backticks (`) and ${} are used to interpolate values into a string.
