# INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPT


```javascript

// Log Codecademy in all uppercase letters
console.log('Codecademy'.toUpperCase()); 

// Use a string method to log the following statment without whitespace at the beginning and end of it.
console.log('    Remove whitespace   '.trim()); 

// Inside of a console.log, create a random number with Math.random, then multiply it by 100.
console.log(Math.random()*100)


// Now, utilize Math.floor to make the output a whole number. Inside the console.log you wrote in the last step, put Math.random() * 100 inside the parentheses of Math.floor.
console.log(Math.ceil(43.8));

// Use the JavaScript documentation to find a method in the Number library that checks if a number is an integer. Put the number 2017 in the parentheses and use console.log() to print the result.
console.log(Number.isInteger(2017))

```



## Let's take one more glance at the concepts we just learned:

  - Four essential data types in JavaScript include strings, numbers, booleans, and null.
  - Data is printed, or logged, to the console with console.log().
  - Four built-in mathematical operators include +, -, *, and /.
  - JavaScript associates certain properties with different data types.
  - JavaScript has built-in methods for different data types.
  - Libraries are collections of methods that can be called without an instance.
  - You can write single-line comments with // and multi-line comments between /* and */.
