# Browser Compatibility and Transpilation

## Babel

1. In the terminal window type:
```bash
npm install babel-cli
```
This installs one of the two required Babel packages.


2. In the terminal window type:
```bash
npm install babel-preset-env
```
This installs the second of two required Babel packages.

3.In the terminal, type 

```bash
npm run build
```
You can view the ES5 code in ./lib/main.js.
You may need to refresh to see the newly created lib directory.

## npm init

In this lesson, you learned about browser compatibility and transpilation. Let's review the key concepts:

- ES5 — The old JavaScript version that is supported by all modern web browsers.
- ES6 — The new(er) JavaScript version that is not supported by all modern web browsers. The syntax is more readable, similar to other programming languages, and addresses the source of common bugs in ES5.

- caniuse.com — a website you can use to look up HTML, CSS, and JavaScript browser compatibility information.
- Babel — A JavaScript package that transpiles JavaScript ES6+ code to ES5.
- npm init — A terminal command that creates a package.json file.
- package.json — A file that contains information about a JavaScript project.
- npm install — A command that installs Node packages.
- babel-cli — A Node package that contains command line tools for Babel.
- babel-preset-env — A Node package that contains ES6+ to ES5 syntax mapping information.
- .babelrc — A file that specifies the version of the JavaScript source code.
- "build" script — A package.json script that you use to tranpsile ES6+ code to ES5.
npm run build — A command that runs the build script and transpiles ES6+ code to ES5.
